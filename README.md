## What Kind of Home Lab do I need?

This will all depend on your level of experience and the avenue of I.T. you are looking to pursue.  As you are begining your career or just starting to learn about I.T. in general we can build out very simple labs by virtualizing different operating systems, even virtualizing network equipment like routers and switches to keep things as simple and as minimal cost as possible.

You can also obtain physical equipment for your home lab as well as some people may prefer working with the physical hardware in front of them.

### Types of Home Labs

The following list are the most common types of home labs that are built.
``` 
Please Note:
Depending on your interests and availibility of resources each home lab
can and will be different from one another.  This is okay.
``` 

* Help Desk Home Labs
* Systems Administrator Home Labs
* Network Administrator Home Labs
* Cloud Engineers Home Labs
* Cybersecurity/Penetration Testing Home Labs

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started with a Physical Lab
---
### <p align="center">`Before we begin discussing the physical lab portion, Virtualization and Cloud Providers are the recommended resources to utilize when creating a home lab.`</p>
---
Depending on your budget and/or ability to obtain the physical hardware(servers, routers, switches, etc..) it will almost always be cheaper to virtualize a lab environment from your existing computer or to utilize the free resources that Amazon's Web Services(AWS) or Microsoft Azure are able to provide.

> AWS Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all

> Microsoft Azure Free Tier: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

You can obtain the physical hardware and equipment through eBay, Craigslist, Facebook, LinkedIn, and More(Contribute to this section?)

* eBay:
  * Servers:
  * Routers
  * Switches: 
* Craigslist: https://craigslist.com
  * Craigslist is location based
* Facebook Groups
  * Facebook Groups are location based
* LinkedIn
  * It's possible you can get lucky through creating valuable connections you can start to obtain older/cheaper equipment.
* Meet Ups
  * It is not advised going to Meet Ups purely to obtain free or cheap equipment but this may be an avenue as well.

``` 
Please Note: When you acquire physical hardware/equipment it will be important to follow specific
guides and/or setup tutorials in relation to the specific model of equipment you obtain.

For instance booting into the BIOS from different manufacturers may differ depending on the model.  
This is important to note when installing Operating Systems, Software, or other Firmware and miscellanious
upgrades that may require booting from different media, like USBs or CD/DVD's, and/or booting from the network.

When completing initial confirgurations or troubleshooting issues with specific hardware you will want
to include in your Google searches: the "*issue*" plus "*model name/number*"

ie: "How to Boot to BIOS on a Dell PowerEdge R720"
